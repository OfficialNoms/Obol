    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h4>How do I check my token balance?</h4>
    <p>Use the <code>/balance</code> command in any channel. It will show you a private list of all your token balances for every game in the server.</p>

    <h4>How do I grant tokens to a user?</h4>
    <p>If you have the "Granter" role for a game, you can use the <code>/token grant</code> command or the "Token Actions" form in the web panel.</p>

    <h4>What's the difference between a "Bot Manager" and a "Game Manager"?</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Bot Managers</strong> are configured per-server (with <code>/config</code>) and can create, delete, and manage ALL games in that server. They are server-level administrators for the bot.<br>
        <strong>Game Managers</strong> are configured per-game. They can't create new games, but they can manage the settings and set token balances for the specific games they are assigned to.
