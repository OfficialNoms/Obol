    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="text-gray-400">Last updated: October 2, 2025</p>

    <p>By inviting the Obol bot to your Discord server or using its associated web panel ("the Service"), you agree to these Terms of Service and the Discord Terms of Service.</p>

    <h3>1. Use of the Service</h3>
    <p>You agree not to use the Service for any illegal or abusive purposes. You are responsible for all data and content managed via the bot within your server. The bot operator reserves the right to suspend service to any server found to be in violation of these terms.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Availability</h3>
    <p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available". We do not guarantee uninterrupted service, as it depends on the stability of our hosting provider and the Discord API.</p>

    <h3>3. Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <p>In no event shall the bot operator be liable for any direct, indirect, or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the Service.</p>

    <h3>4. Changes to Terms</h3>
    <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.</p>
